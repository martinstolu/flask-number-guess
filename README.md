# 🎲 Number Guessing Game – Flask Web App

## About

A fun and lightweight number guessing game built using Python and Flask. When you visit the app in your browser, you're prompted to guess a number between 0 and 9 by typing it into the URL (e.g., `/5`). The app tells you if your guess is too low, too high, or just right — complete with playful feedback and GIFs.
